## ICP Prioritization Matrix

| ICP | ACV Potential | Sales Cycle | Market Size | Strategic Value | Priority |
|-----|---------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| ICP-1: Engagement DAO | Medium ($1-2K/yr) | Medium (4-8wk) | Large | High (reference) | **#1** |
| ICP-2: Growing NFT | Low ($0-1K/yr) | Short (2-4wk) | Very Large | Medium (volume) | **#2** |
| ICP-3: DeFi Protocol | High ($5-10K/yr) | Long (8-16wk) | Medium | High (credibility) | **#3** |

### Prioritization Rationale

**ICP-1 (DAOs) is primary because:**
- Highest retention (treasury-funded, ongoing need)
- Best product-market fit (engagement focus)
- Reasonable sales cycle
- Strong reference value

**ICP-2 (NFT Projects) is secondary because:**
- Volume opportunity (thousands of projects)
- Viral potential (projects share tools)
- Fast sales cycle for rapid iteration
- But: higher churn, price sensitive

**ICP-3 (DeFi Protocols) is tertiary because:**
- Highest ACV but longest cycle
- Credibility signal if won
- Resource-intensive sales
- Best approached after product maturity
