## Executive Summary

Arrakis pricing is designed around **value-based differentiation** - charging for intelligence and engagement capabilities that competitors don't offer, while maintaining a free tier for market entry. The strategy balances bootstrapped constraints with revenue growth targets.

**Pricing Philosophy:**
> Price for value delivered (engagement intelligence), not commoditized features (token-gating). Free tier for adoption, premium for differentiation, enterprise for scale.

**Target Revenue:**
- Year 1: $100K+ ARR
- Year 2: $500K ARR
- Year 3: $1.5M ARR

## Pricing Philosophy

### Core Principles

| Principle | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Value-Based** | Price on outcomes (engagement), not inputs (features) |
| **Freemium Entry** | Free tier mandatory to compete with Guild.xyz |
| **Tiered Progression** | Mirror product's tier system in pricing |
| **Predictable** | Flat monthly vs usage-based (avoids Collab.Land complexity) |
| **Land & Expand** | Start free, upgrade as community grows |

### What We Charge For

| Charge For | Don't Charge For |
|------------|------------------|
| Conviction scoring | Basic token-gating |
| SietchTheme (9-tier) | BasicTheme (3-tier) |
| On-chain analytics | Balance checks |
| Enterprise security | Standard security |
| Custom themes | Default themes |
| Priority support | Community support |

### Pricing Strategy Type

**Freemium with Feature Gates**

| Aspect | Approach |
|--------|----------|
| Entry | Free forever (BasicTheme) |
| Upgrade Trigger | Value realization (conviction data) |
| Expansion | Community size + feature needs |
| Enterprise | Custom pricing for large/complex |

## Pricing Psychology

**Present tiers in this order:** Enterprise → Premium → Free

| Tier | Role | Psychology |
|------|------|------------|
| Enterprise ($399) | Anchor | Makes Premium seem affordable |
| Premium ($99) | Target | "Only 25% of Enterprise" |
| Free ($0) | Entry | "Start here, grow later" |

### Value Framing

**Premium vs Free:**
> "For less than the cost of one NFT per month, know which of your holders are diamond hands."

**Premium vs Collab.Land Elite:**
> "Get conviction scoring and 9-tier progression for 78% less than Collab.Land Elite."

**Annual vs Monthly:**
> "Save 20% with annual billing - that's 2.4 months free."

### Upgrade Triggers

| Trigger | From → To | Message |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Shadow mode value | Free → Premium | "You've seen your conviction data. Ready to act on it?" |
| Community growth | Free → Premium | "Growing past BasicTheme? SietchTheme rewards your top holders." |
| Multi-server need | Premium → Enterprise | "Managing multiple communities? Consolidate with Enterprise." |
| Security requirements | Premium → Enterprise | "Need audit trails and custom SLAs? Enterprise has you covered." |

## Objection Handling (Price)

### "Guild.xyz is free"

> "Guild.xyz is free because they don't offer conviction scoring or tiered progression. Those features require on-chain analytics that we've spent years building at Dune. The question isn't whether $99/mo is worth it - it's whether knowing your diamond hands before your next airdrop is worth $99/mo. Usually that airdrop is worth millions."

### "Collab.Land is cheaper"

> "Collab.Land Starter is free for basic gating. Our Free tier matches that. If you're comparing our Premium ($99) to their Standard (~$99-199), we include conviction scoring and 9-tier progression that they don't offer at any price. And our Enterprise ($399) includes features that cost $449 at Collab.Land Elite."

### "We're a small project"

> "That's why we have a Free tier that works forever. Start there, see the value in shadow mode. When you grow and want to reward your top holders differently, upgrade to Premium. We're not trying to charge you before you can afford it."

### "$99/mo is a lot for a Discord bot"

> "It's not a Discord bot - it's community intelligence. Do you know which of your holders are diamond hands right now? Which ones held through the dip? Who should be in your Naib council? That's what $99/mo buys. The question is: what's a bad airdrop cost you?"

### "We'll build it ourselves"

> "We've done 65+ sprints of hardening over years. How many engineers will you dedicate to a Discord bot instead of your core product? And our conviction scoring is powered by the #1 Dune team's data - that's not something you rebuild in a weekend."
