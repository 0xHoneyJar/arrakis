## Executive Summary

Arrakis partnership strategy focuses on **ecosystem integration** and **channel partnerships** that amplify reach without proportional resource investment. Given bootstrapped constraints (1-3 person team), partnerships must be high-leverage - generating leads, credibility, or distribution at minimal ongoing cost.

**Partnership Philosophy:**
> Partner where our weakness meets their strength. We have technology; partners have distribution, credibility, or complementary capabilities.

**Year 1 Partnership Targets:**
- 5 Strategic integrations (tooling/infrastructure)
- 10 Channel partners (DAOs, accelerators)
- 3 Ecosystem relationships (L2s, chains)
- 1 Anchor customer (case study)

Would you have 20 minutes to explore partnership possibilities?

Best,
