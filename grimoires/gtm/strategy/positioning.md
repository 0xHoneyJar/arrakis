## Executive Summary

Arrakis is positioned as the **engagement intelligence extension** for Collab.Land - built on top of the industry's most trusted token-gating infrastructure. By extending Collab.Land rather than competing with it, Arrakis inherits all of Collab.Land's trust assumptions, security, and proven technology (wallet connection, verification, etc.) while adding a unique engagement intelligence layer powered by **Dune Analytics expertise**.

**Core Positioning:**
> Arrakis extends Collab.Land with engagement intelligence. Powered by Dune. Built on top of the token-gating standard, available through the Collab.Land marketplace. You trust Collab.Land — we make it smarter with on-chain data.

**Key Trust Message:**
> You don't need to trust anything beyond Collab.Land. Arrakis uses their infrastructure for wallet connection and verification. We add the power of on-chain analytics — no SQL required.

**Dune Power Message:**
> We bring the power of Dune Analytics to your Discord — no queries, no dashboards, no code. Just actionable community intelligence delivered automatically.

## The Dune Advantage

### The Analogy

**"Arrakis is like having a Dune Analytics wizard embedded in your Discord."**

Think of it this way:
- **Dune Analytics** = Bloomberg Terminal for crypto (powerful, but requires expertise)
- **Arrakis** = Bloomberg data delivered as a simple dashboard to your phone

Or in community terms:
- **Raw on-chain data** = A library full of books in every language
- **Dune dashboards** = A skilled translator who can read any book
- **Arrakis** = That translator summarizing the key insights in plain English, delivered to your Discord

### No-Code, Curated, Engaging

| Traditional Analytics | Arrakis Approach |
|-----------------------|------------------|
| Write SQL queries | Zero code required |
| Build dashboards manually | Pre-built conviction scoring |
| Export CSVs and analyze | Real-time Discord roles |
| Hire data analysts | Self-service wizard |
| Static snapshots | Dynamic 6-hour updates |

**The Promise:** The #1 Dune team spent years mastering on-chain analytics. Now that expertise is packaged into a 15-minute setup that anyone can use.

## Positioning Statement

### Primary Positioning Statement

**For** Web3 community operators (DAOs, NFT projects, DeFi protocols)

**Who** already trust Collab.Land for token-gating and want to go deeper

**Arrakis** is an engagement intelligence extension for Collab.Land

**That** adds conviction scoring, tiered progression, and gamification on top of Collab.Land's proven infrastructure

**Unlike** standalone alternatives that require you to trust new infrastructure

**Our product** inherits Collab.Land's security and trust while bringing the power of Dune Analytics to your Discord — no queries, no code, just actionable community intelligence. Built by the #1 Dune team.

### Simplified One-Liner

> "The engagement layer for Collab.Land. Powered by Dune. Know your community, not just your holders."

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

"You already trust Collab.Land for token-gating. Arrakis extends it with engagement intelligence powered by Dune Analytics. We bring the same on-chain data expertise that powers the top Dune dashboards — but you don't need to write a single query. Built on Collab.Land, available through their marketplace. Find your diamond hands, reward your believers, drive engagement — all with the power of on-chain analytics, no code required."

### Extended Pitch (60 seconds)

"Every Web3 community faces the same problem: Collab.Land tells you who holds your token, but you can't tell who actually cares about your project versus who's farming your airdrop. To get that insight, you'd need to hire a data analyst, write Dune queries, and stare at dashboards all day.

Arrakis changes that. We're built by the #1 team on Dune Analytics, and we bring that same on-chain intelligence directly to your Discord — no queries, no dashboards, no code. Think of it as having a Dune wizard embedded in your server, automatically identifying your diamond hands and rewarding them.

Built directly on top of Collab.Land, available through their marketplace. We inherit their security, their wallet connection, their verification. You don't need to trust anything new.

We add conviction scoring that analyzes holding duration, trading patterns, and on-chain activity. Then we reward your believers with a 9-tier progression system — Naib council at the top, Outsiders working their way up.

The power of Dune Analytics. The simplicity of a 15-minute setup. No code required."
