## Hero Section

### Headline
# Find your diamond hands before your next airdrop

### Subheadline
Your DAO has thousands of token holders. But how many are true believers? Arrakis identifies your most committed members through conviction scoring — so your governance gets real participation and your airdrops go to real supporters.

## Problem Section

### Headline
## The engagement problem every DAO faces

### Problem Cards

#### Everyone Looks the Same
Token balance doesn't tell you who held through the bear market versus who bought yesterday. Your oldest supporters are invisible.

#### Airdrops Go to Farmers
You spend months planning a fair distribution. Then bots and mercenaries claim 60%+ of it. Your real community gets diluted.

#### 5% Governance Participation
Thousands of token holders, but only a handful vote. The people who care most have no special recognition or incentive.

#### Tool Sprawl
Collab.Land for gating. MEE6 for levels. Guild.xyz for requirements. Custom scripts for snapshots. It's a mess.

## Solution Section

### Headline
## Arrakis brings engagement intelligence to your DAO

### Solution Intro
We analyze on-chain behavior to identify who truly believes in your DAO — then create tiered experiences that reward them.

### Key Capabilities for DAOs

#### Conviction Scoring for Airdrops
Know who your diamond hands are before you distribute. Our scoring analyzes holding duration, trading patterns, and activity to separate believers from farmers.

**Result:** Fair airdrops that reward contribution, not exploitation.

#### Tiered Governance Recognition
Your Naib council (top 7 holders) gets visible status. Fedaykin Elite have their own channels. Create a hierarchy that reflects commitment.

**Result:** Governance participation increases when members feel recognized.

#### Pre-Airdrop Planning
Export conviction data for your snapshot. Identify which addresses should be excluded (recent buyers, known farmers) and which deserve extra allocation.

**Result:** Distribution that aligns with your DAO's values.

#### Consolidated Tooling
Replace your Collab.Land + MEE6 + custom scripts stack with one platform. Token-gating, tiers, badges, and analytics in one place.

**Result:** Less maintenance, clearer operations.

## How DAOs Use Arrakis

### Use Case 1: Fair Airdrop Distribution

**The Scenario:**
Your DAO is planning a major airdrop. Last time, farmers claimed most of it. This time needs to be different.

**With Arrakis:**
1. Run shadow mode to see conviction scores for all holders
2. Identify diamond hands (high conviction) vs recent buyers (low conviction)
3. Export data for your snapshot tool
4. Weight distribution by conviction, not just balance
5. Execute airdrop with confidence

**The Outcome:**
Tokens go to members who've been contributing for months, not accounts that appeared last week.

---

### Use Case 2: Governance Engagement

**The Scenario:**
Your governance proposals get 3-5% participation. Critical votes pass with a handful of wallets. You need more engagement.

**With Arrakis:**
1. Implement 9-tier progression based on conviction
2. Create Naib-only governance channels for top members
3. Award "Voter" badges for participation
4. Surface diamond hands in your Discord
5. Recognize contributors publicly

**The Outcome:**
Members see a path to status. Participation increases because engagement is visible and rewarded.

---

### Use Case 3: Operational Consolidation

**The Scenario:**
You're running Collab.Land for gating, MEE6 for XP, Guild.xyz for some requirements, and custom scripts for analytics. It's fragile and time-consuming.

**With Arrakis:**
1. Start in shadow mode alongside existing tools
2. Validate conviction data accuracy
3. Migrate tier roles to Arrakis
4. Sunset redundant bots
5. Manage everything from one platform

**The Outcome:**
One tool instead of four. Less maintenance, clearer member experience.

## Objection Handling

### "We already use Collab.Land"

Perfect — Arrakis runs in shadow mode alongside it. See your conviction data without changing anything. Collab.Land tells you who holds tokens. Arrakis tells you who believes.

### "Our community is used to the current setup"

Tiered progression adds to their experience, it doesn't change what works. Your diamond hands finally get recognized. That's a feature, not a disruption.

### "How do we know conviction scoring works?"

We'll show you your data in shadow mode. You validate before committing. If our scoring doesn't match your intuition about who your believers are, don't switch.

### "We're a treasury-funded DAO with limited budget"

Premium is $99/month — less than $1,200/year from your treasury. One prevented farmer-captured airdrop pays for decades of Arrakis.
