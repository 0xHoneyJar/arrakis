## Problem Section

### Headline
## Sound familiar?

### Problem Cards

#### Post-Mint Silence
Your Discord was electric during mint week. Now it's crickets. The same people who refreshed OpenSea every hour are gone.

#### Floor-Watchers Everywhere
Half your "holders" are just waiting to dump. They're not collectors — they're exit liquidity. But they look exactly like your believers.

#### OGs Feel Invisible
Someone who minted day one and held through the floor gets the same experience as someone who bought yesterday. No recognition. No reward.

#### Generic Discord Vibes
Every NFT server looks the same: holder-verified channel, announcements, general chat. Nothing that makes your community feel special.

## Solution Section

### Headline
## Arrakis turns holders into a community

### Solution Intro
We analyze on-chain behavior to identify your true collectors — not just who holds, but who believes. Then we create tiered experiences that reward commitment.

### Key Capabilities for NFT Projects

#### Identify Collectors vs Flippers
Conviction scoring goes beyond wallet snapshots. We track holding duration, accumulation patterns, and trading behavior to surface your real collectors.

**Result:** Stop treating flippers the same as believers.

#### 9-Tier Holder Progression
From Outsider to Naib, your holders earn status as they prove commitment. Your top 7 holders become your council. Tiered channels create aspirational culture.

**Result:** Holding becomes a journey, not just a transaction.

#### OG Recognition with Badges
Automatic badges for first-wave minters, long-term holders, multi-NFT collectors, and more. Create collector culture where tenure matters.

**Result:** Your earliest believers finally get recognition.

#### Stand Out from Generic Servers
Dune-themed tiers (Fedaykin, Fremen, Wanderer) create unique identity. Custom themes available on Enterprise for full branding control.

**Result:** A Discord experience as unique as your art.

## How NFT Projects Use Arrakis

### Use Case 1: Post-Mint Engagement Recovery

**The Scenario:**
You minted out 3 months ago. Initial hype faded. Discord engagement dropped 80%. You need to reignite the community without another mint.

**With Arrakis:**
1. Install Arrakis in shadow mode — see holder conviction data
2. Identify your diamond hands (high conviction) vs floor-watchers (low conviction)
3. Enable 9-tier progression with SietchTheme
4. Create tier-gated channels (Fedaykin+ discussions, Naib council)
5. Roll out badge recognition for early minters

**The Outcome:**
Holders see a path to status. Floor-watchers either commit or leave. Your believers finally feel recognized.

---

### Use Case 2: Holder Airdrops Done Right

**The Scenario:**
You're planning a companion drop or token airdrop. Last time, secondary buyers who held for 12 hours got the same allocation as day-one minters. Not this time.

**With Arrakis:**
1. Run conviction analysis on your holder base
2. Identify holding duration and accumulation patterns
3. Export conviction data for your snapshot
4. Weight allocations by conviction score, not just ownership
5. Execute distribution that rewards true collectors

**The Outcome:**
Your OGs get more. Recent buyers get less. The community sees you reward loyalty.

---

### Use Case 3: Multi-NFT Holder Recognition

**The Scenario:**
Some holders own 10+ pieces from your collection. Others own 1. Currently they get identical Discord roles. Your whales feel undervalued.

**With Arrakis:**
1. Configure tier thresholds based on quantity + duration
2. Multi-NFT holders automatically rank higher
3. Create whale-only channels (Naib council for top 7)
4. Surface top collectors in member list with gold roles
5. Enable holder-to-holder badge gifting (lineage)

**The Outcome:**
Your biggest supporters get visible recognition. Collector culture drives accumulation.

## Objection Handling

### "We're a small project"

Start free with BasicTheme. See the value before spending anything. Premium is less than one secondary sale per month — and it helps you get more sales.

### "Our community is used to Collab.Land"

Shadow mode runs alongside your current setup. Your holders won't even notice until you're ready to switch. Zero disruption.

### "We can't afford premium tools"

Free tier is genuinely useful. Premium at $99/month is the cost of 0.05 ETH — one secondary sale covers months of service. The ROI comes from better holder retention.

### "Sounds complicated"

15-minute wizard. No code. Choose your theme, enter your contract address, deploy. We guide you through every step.

### "How does tier progression drive engagement?"

Status is powerful. When your holders see a path from Outsider to Naib council, they're incentivized to hold and accumulate. Visible tier roles create FOMO.
