## What Matrica Does Well

### Comprehensive NFT Community Platform

Matrica is purpose-built for NFT communities, especially in the Solana ecosystem. They offer tools Arrakis doesn't have.

**Their strengths:**
- Deep Solana integration
- Bitcoin Ordinals and Runes support
- Sales bots with rank/rarity data
- Event management with QR ticketing
- Compressed NFT (cNFT) support
- On-chain voting and proposals
- Portfolio tracking

**If you're a Solana NFT project** needing sales feeds, event management, and ecosystem-specific features, Matrica is built for you.

## What Arrakis Adds

### Engagement Intelligence Over Feature Breadth

Matrica offers many tools. Arrakis goes deep on one thing: understanding who matters in your community.

#### Conviction Scoring
Matrica can verify holdings. Arrakis analyzes *behavior* — how long held, trading patterns, accumulation vs distribution. This reveals true believers vs tourists.

**The difference:** Both verify you own an NFT. Only Arrakis tells you if you're a diamond hand or a flipper.

#### 9-Tier Progression System
Matrica offers attribute-based roles. Arrakis offers dynamic conviction-based progression — a full hierarchy from Outsider to Naib with visible rank competition.

**The difference:** Matrica: "You hold a rare trait NFT." Arrakis: "You're #8 in conviction, climbing toward Fedaykin Elite."

#### Shadow Mode
Matrica requires commitment. Arrakis lets you run in shadow mode — see conviction data for your community without changing anything. Evaluate before switching.

#### EVM Focus
Matrica spreads across 8 chains with Solana emphasis. Arrakis goes deep on EVM chains through Score Service integration, optimized for conviction analysis.

## Ecosystem Considerations

### Solana vs EVM

| Ecosystem | Matrica | Arrakis |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Solana | ✓ Primary | — |
| Ethereum | ✓ | ✓ |
| Polygon | ✓ | ✓ |
| Arbitrum | ~ | ✓ |
| Base | ✓ | ✓ |
| Bitcoin (Ordinals) | ✓ | — |

### Choose Based on Your Chain

**If you're primarily Solana:** Matrica has deeper ecosystem integration.

**If you're primarily EVM:** Arrakis provides conviction intelligence that Matrica lacks.

**If you're multi-chain with Solana:** Consider Matrica for Solana-specific features, potentially Arrakis for EVM intelligence.

## When to Choose Each

### Choose Matrica If:

- You're a Solana-first NFT project
- You need sales bots with rank/rarity
- Event management (IRL or virtual) is important
- You want Bitcoin Ordinals/Runes support
- Portfolio tracking matters to your community
- You need on-chain voting/proposals

### Choose Arrakis If:

- You're primarily on EVM chains
- You need to identify diamond hands vs flippers
- Airdrop fairness requires conviction data
- You want tiered progression based on commitment
- Analytics and holder insights matter
- You want to evaluate with shadow mode first

### Consider Both If:

- You operate across Solana and EVM
- You want Matrica for NFT tools + Arrakis for conviction
- Different community segments need different tools

---

## Feature Deep Dive

### Conviction Scoring (Arrakis Only)

Matrica verifies current holdings. Arrakis analyzes historical behavior:

| What We Analyze | Why It Matters |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Holding duration | 2-year holder ≠ yesterday's buyer |
| Trading patterns | Accumulator ≠ flipper |
| Transaction history | Active participant ≠ dormant wallet |
| Cross-wallet activity | Pattern recognition |

**Result:** Conviction scores that identify your true community.

### NFT-Specific Tools (Matrica Only)

| Tool | What It Does |
|------|--------------|
| Sales Bot | Alerts on sales with rank, rarity, price |
| Collection Analytics | Floor, volume, holder distribution |
| Event Management | Create events, gate with NFTs, QR check-in |
| Voting | On-chain proposals using NFT holdings |

**Result:** Comprehensive NFT community operations.

## Migration Considerations

### Coming from Matrica

If switching from Matrica to Arrakis:

1. **What you lose:** Sales bots, event management, Solana-specific features
2. **What you gain:** Conviction scoring, 9-tier progression, shadow mode
3. **Migration path:** Arrakis shadow mode → parallel evaluation → decision

### Adding Arrakis to Matrica

You don't have to choose one:

- Keep Matrica for NFT operations (sales, events, Solana)
- Add Arrakis for conviction intelligence (airdrops, governance tiering)
- Different tools for different purposes

---

## Objection Handling

### "Matrica has more features"

True — Matrica is a broader platform. Arrakis goes deep on one thing: engagement intelligence. If you need sales bots and events, Matrica has those. If you need to know who your diamond hands are, we do that.

### "We're a Solana project"

Matrica is the better choice for Solana-specific features. We focus on EVM chains with deep conviction analysis. Different ecosystems, different tools.

### "Matrica has Bitcoin Ordinals support"

They do. We don't. If Ordinals are core to your community, Matrica serves that need. If you're EVM-focused and need conviction data, that's our focus.

### "We need event management"

Matrica's event system is real value. We don't offer that. Consider whether conviction intelligence or event tools matter more — or use both for different purposes.

### "Same price, more features with Matrica"

Feature count isn't the question. The question is: Do you need to know who your most committed members are? That intelligence — conviction scoring — isn't available in Matrica at any price.
