## Comparison: Extension vs Alternatives

### Headline
## Why extend Collab.Land instead of switching?

### Comparison Table

| Approach | Trust Required | Migration | Risk |
|----------|---------------|-----------|------|
| **Arrakis (Collab.Land extension)** | None new — uses Collab.Land | None | Zero |
| Guild.xyz | New platform trust | Full migration | Medium |

### URL Consideration
Consider renaming from `/compare/vs-collabland` to `/collab-land` or `/extend-collabland` to reflect extension rather than competition.
