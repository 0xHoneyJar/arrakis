## What Arrakis Adds

### From Access Management to Engagement Intelligence

Guild.xyz tells you who *can* access. Arrakis tells you who *matters*.

#### Conviction Scoring
Guild.xyz checks if requirements are met right now. Arrakis analyzes behavior over time — holding duration, trading patterns, accumulation — to identify who truly believes in your project.

**The difference:** A wallet that bought yesterday and one that held for two years both pass Guild.xyz requirements. Only Arrakis distinguishes them.

#### 9-Tier Progression
Guild.xyz assigns roles based on requirements. Arrakis creates a progression journey from Outsider to Naib. Your community has visible hierarchy that drives engagement through status.

**The difference:** Guild.xyz: "You meet requirements." Arrakis: "You're rank #12 and climbing toward Fedaykin Elite."

#### Telegram Support
Guild.xyz focuses on Discord and web platforms. Arrakis supports both Discord and Telegram for communities that span both platforms.

#### Shadow Mode
Guild.xyz is all-or-nothing. Arrakis lets you run in shadow mode alongside any existing setup — see conviction data before committing.

---

## The Free vs Paid Trade-off

### Guild.xyz: Free Everything

Guild.xyz offers all features free. That's compelling. But there's no engagement intelligence at any price point.

### Arrakis: Free + Premium Intelligence

| Feature Set | Guild.xyz | Arrakis |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| Basic token-gating | Free | Free |
| 60+ chains | Free | — |
| Off-chain requirements | Free | — |
| Conviction scoring | — Not available | $99/mo |
| 9-tier progression | — Not available | $99/mo |
| Analytics + insights | — Not available | $99/mo |
| Telegram support | — Not available | $99/mo |

### The Question to Ask

**If you only need access control:** Guild.xyz free tier is hard to beat.

**If you need to know who your diamond hands are:** No amount of Guild.xyz features provides that. Arrakis Premium does.

---

## When to Choose Each

### Choose Guild.xyz If:

- Free is the primary requirement
- You need 60+ chain support
- You want off-chain requirements (GitHub, Twitter)
- Access management is the only goal
- You don't need conviction data

### Choose Arrakis If:

- You need to identify your most valuable members
- You're planning airdrops and need conviction data
- You want tiered progression to drive engagement
- You need Telegram support
- You want analytics and holder insights
- You value engagement over just access

### Use Both If:

- You want Guild.xyz for off-chain requirements
- You want Arrakis for on-chain intelligence
- Different use cases in the same community

## Pricing Analysis

### Cost vs Value

| What You Get | Guild.xyz | Arrakis |
|--------------|-----------|---------|
| Token-gating | Free | Free |
| Multi-chain | Free (60+) | Free |
| Off-chain requirements | Free | — |
| Conviction scoring | — | $99/mo |
| 9-tier progression | — | $99/mo |
| Analytics dashboard | — | $99/mo |
| Telegram | — | $99/mo |
| Enterprise features | — | $399/mo |

### ROI Calculation

**Scenario:** Planning a $1M airdrop

**With Guild.xyz (free):**
- Gate access based on requirements
- No insight into who's a farmer vs believer
- Risk: 50%+ goes to farmers

**With Arrakis ($99/mo):**
- Conviction scoring identifies diamond hands
- Weight distribution by commitment
- Better allocation to true community

**ROI:** If conviction data improves distribution by even 10%, that's $100,000 value for $99/month.

## Migration Path

### Coming from Guild.xyz

Guild.xyz and Arrakis serve different purposes. You may not need to "migrate" — you might use both.

#### Option 1: Replace
If you want conviction-based tiering instead of requirements-based access, switch to Arrakis.

1. Install Arrakis in shadow mode
2. See conviction data for your holders
3. Configure tier thresholds
4. Deploy when ready

#### Option 2: Complement
Use Guild.xyz for complex requirements logic. Use Arrakis for conviction intelligence.

- Guild.xyz: "Must follow our Twitter AND hold 100 tokens"
- Arrakis: "Rank holders by conviction, top 7 are Naib council"

#### Option 3: Evaluate First
Run Arrakis shadow mode without changing Guild.xyz. See what conviction data reveals. Decide based on insights.

## Objection Handling

### "Guild.xyz is free — why pay for Arrakis?"

Free is great for access control. But when you need to know who your diamond hands are — not just who holds tokens — Guild.xyz can't tell you. No free tool can. That intelligence has value, especially before airdrops.

### "Guild.xyz has more chain support (60+ vs Score Service)"

True. If you need specific chains Guild.xyz supports that we don't, use Guild.xyz for those. But chain count doesn't reveal conviction. A holder on 60 chains means nothing if you don't know which ones are farmers.

### "I need off-chain requirements (GitHub, Twitter)"

Guild.xyz is better for that. We focus on on-chain intelligence. Consider using both — Guild.xyz for off-chain requirements, Arrakis for conviction-based tiering.

### "Everything I need is free with Guild.xyz"

If access management is all you need, stay with Guild.xyz. But ask: Do you know who your top 7 holders are? Who's held longest? Who's accumulating vs selling? If those questions matter, that's where we start.
