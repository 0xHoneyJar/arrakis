## FAQ Section

### Section Headline
## Frequently asked questions

### FAQs

#### Can I try Premium features before paying?
Yes! Shadow mode is available on the Free tier. You can see conviction data for your community without changing anything. When you're ready for tiered progression and full analytics, upgrade to Premium.

#### What happens if I exceed my server limit?
On Premium, you can add additional Discord servers at $29/month each, or upgrade to Enterprise for unlimited servers.

#### Can I switch plans anytime?
Yes. Upgrade anytime and your new features activate immediately. Downgrade takes effect at the next billing cycle.

#### What's the refund policy?
Annual plans: Pro-rated refund within 30 days. Monthly plans: No refunds, but you can cancel anytime.

#### Do you offer discounts for DAOs?
Our standard pricing is designed for DAO treasuries. Founding 50 members get 50% off Premium for life. Annual billing saves 20%.

#### What chains do you support?
All major EVM chains through our Score Service, including Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, and more.

#### Is my community data secure?
Yes. We use PostgreSQL with row-level security (RLS) for complete tenant isolation. Enterprise tier includes full audit trails for compliance.

#### Can I use Arrakis alongside Collab.Land?
Absolutely. Shadow mode is designed for this. Run Arrakis in parallel, see your conviction data, and switch when you're confident. Zero risk.

#### What's the Founding 50 offer?
The first 50 customers who sign up for Premium get 50% off for life. That's $49/month instead of $99/month, locked in forever. Must commit to annual billing.

## Page Notes

### Pricing Psychology
- Enterprise shown first in comparison (anchoring)
- Premium highlighted as "Most Popular"
- Free tier generous enough to be useful
- Founding 50 creates urgency

### Objection Handling Built In
- "Can I try first?" → Shadow mode on Free
- "What if I need more?" → Add-ons available
- "Is it secure?" → RLS mentioned
- "Can I use with current setup?" → Coexistence emphasized

### SEO Keywords
- token gating pricing
- discord bot pricing
- dao tools pricing
- web3 community tools cost
- collab.land alternative pricing

### A/B Test Candidates
- Price points ($79 vs $99 vs $149)
- Annual discount (15% vs 20% vs 25%)
- Founding 50 spots shown vs hidden
- Feature comparison expanded vs collapsed
