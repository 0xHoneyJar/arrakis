## Conviction Scoring

### Section ID
`#conviction-scoring`

### Badge
Premium Feature

### Headline
## Know who your diamond hands are

### Description
Token balance tells you who holds. Conviction scoring tells you who believes.

We analyze on-chain behavior to identify your most valuable community members — not just the biggest bags, but the truest believers.

### How It Works

#### Holding Duration
How long have they held? Someone who bought two years ago and never sold is different from someone who bought yesterday.

#### Trading Patterns
Are they accumulating or distributing? Diamond hands add to positions during dips. Flippers take profit at every pump.

#### On-Chain Activity
What else are they doing? Active governance participation, protocol usage, and ecosystem engagement all factor in.

### Use Cases

| Use Case | How Conviction Helps |
|----------|---------------------|
| **Airdrops** | Distribute to believers, not farmers |
| **Governance** | Weight votes by conviction, not just balance |
| **Tiered Access** | Reserve exclusive channels for diamond hands |
| **Community Recognition** | Surface your most committed members |

## Tier Progression

### Section ID
`#tier-progression`

### Headline
## 9 tiers from Outsider to Naib

### Description
Create a progression journey that rewards your most committed members with visible status. Our Dune-themed tier system drives engagement through recognition, not just access.

### Tier Systems

#### BasicTheme (Free)
Simple 3-tier system for getting started.

| Tier | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🥇 Gold | Top holders |
| 🥈 Silver | Mid-tier holders |
| 🥉 Bronze | Entry-level holders |

#### SietchTheme (Premium)
Full 9-tier progression inspired by Dune.

| Tier | Rank | Role Color | Description |
|------|------|------------|-------------|
| **Naib** | 1-7 | Gold | Council leadership — your inner circle |
| **Fedaykin Elite** | 8-15 | Light Gold | Elite warriors — trusted lieutenants |

| **Observer** | 67-69 | Charcoal | Watching — minimal commitment |
| **Outsider** | 70+ | Gray | Just arrived — proving ground |

#### Custom Themes (Enterprise)
Design your own tier system with custom names, colors, and thresholds.

### How Progression Works

1. **Automatic Ranking** — Members ranked by conviction score (Premium) or balance (Free)
2. **Role Assignment** — Discord roles assigned based on tier
3. **Dynamic Updates** — Tiers refresh every 6 hours (Premium) or 24 hours (Free)
4. **Channel Access** — Gate channels by tier (Naib-only channels, Fremen+ access, etc.)

## Shadow Mode

### Section ID

### Badge
Zero-Risk Adoption

### Headline
## Try alongside your current setup

### Description
Already using Collab.Land or Guild.xyz? Shadow mode lets you run Arrakis in parallel without changing anything. See your conviction data, validate accuracy, switch when you're ready.

### How Shadow Mode Works

```
Your Current Setup          Arrakis Shadow Mode
      │                            │
      ▼                            ▼

                 │
                 ▼
         Your Discord Server
```

### Operating Modes

| Mode | Description | Risk Level |
|------|-------------|------------|
| **Shadow** | Observe only — see conviction data without any changes | Zero |
| **Parallel** | Run namespaced roles alongside incumbent | Low |
| **Primary** | Arrakis becomes authoritative | Medium |
| **Exclusive** | Full takeover, incumbent roles removed | Full switch |

### Migration Path

1. **Start in Shadow** — Install Arrakis, observe your conviction data
2. **Validate Accuracy** — Compare scoring to your intuition about members
3. **Test Parallel** — Run both systems, see Arrakis roles alongside existing
4. **Switch When Ready** — Promote Arrakis to primary when confident

| Cloud | AWS EKS (Kubernetes) |
