## Problem Section

### Section Headline
## On-chain data is powerful. But who has time for SQL?

### Problem Cards

#### Card 1: You Need a Data Analyst
Getting conviction insights requires writing Dune queries, building dashboards, and hiring someone who understands on-chain data. Most communities can't afford that.

#### Card 2: Airdrops Go to Farmers
Without on-chain intelligence, you can't tell diamond hands from day traders. Millions in tokens go to bots and mercenaries.

#### Card 3: Analytics Stay in Spreadsheets
Even if you build the dashboards, insights live in CSVs — not where your community actually engages (Discord).

#### Card 4: Data Gets Stale
One-time snapshots tell you about yesterday. Community composition changes constantly.

## Solution Section

### Section Headline
## A Dune wizard embedded in your Discord

### Solution Intro
Think of Arrakis as having the #1 Dune Analytics team working for you full-time — analyzing your holders, identifying conviction, and delivering insights as Discord roles. No queries. No dashboards. Just intelligence.

### The Analogy
> **Dune Analytics** = Bloomberg Terminal for crypto (powerful, but requires expertise)
> **Arrakis** = Bloomberg data delivered as a simple app on your phone

### Feature Highlights

#### Zero Code Required
We've spent years mastering on-chain analytics. Now that expertise is packaged into a 15-minute setup anyone can use.
