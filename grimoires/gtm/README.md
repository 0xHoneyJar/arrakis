## How These Documents Were Created

### The Process

This GTM package was created using the **Loa Framework's GTM Collective** - a coordinated set of AI agents that specialize in different aspects of go-to-market strategy. The process followed a structured workflow:

```
Step 1: /gtm-setup
        ↓ Adopted technical docs (PRD/SDD) into product brief

Step 2: /analyze-market
        ↓ Created ICP profiles, competitive analysis, market landscape

Step 3: /position
        ↓ Built positioning strategy and messaging framework

Step 4: /price
        ↓ Developed pricing strategy and tier structure

Step 5: /plan-partnerships
        ↓ Created partnership and BD strategy

Step 6: /plan-devrel
        ↓ Built developer relations strategy

Step 7: /plan-launch
        ↓ Created content calendar and launch plan

Step 8: /create-deck
        ↓ Developed pitch deck content

Step 9: Website Content Sessions (6 sessions)
        ↓ Created all website copy following the content plan

Step 10: /review-gtm
         ↓ Cross-functional review and validation
```

### Grounding in Technical Reality

All marketing claims are grounded in the actual technical capabilities documented in:
- `loa-grimoire/prd.md` (Product Requirements Document)
- `loa-grimoire/sdd.md` (Software Design Document)

The `context/product-reality.md` file maps marketing claims to technical reality to prevent over-promising.

## Notes for Reviewers

### What Needs Action

1. **Legal Review Required**
   - `legal/terms.md` and `legal/privacy.md` are templates
   - Need attorney review before publication
   - Jurisdiction and arbitration clauses need completion

2. **Testimonials Needed**
   - Placeholder quotes marked `[Replace with real testimonial]`
   - Need customer quotes from soft launch

3. **Visual Assets**
   - Documents reference images not yet created
   - See `execution/website-content-plan.md` for asset list

4. **Pricing Validation**
   - Pricing strategy needs market validation
   - Founding 50 offer details need finalization

### What's Ready to Use

- All core messaging and positioning
- Website copy structure and content
- Competitor comparison frameworks
- Pitch deck narrative
- Launch timeline and strategy

---

All documents follow consistent formatting:

- **YAML frontmatter** with status, date, author
