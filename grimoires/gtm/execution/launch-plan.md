## Executive Summary

Arrakis launch is a **staged rollout** designed to validate product-market fit with minimal risk before broader announcement. The strategy leverages the Dune Analytics team credibility and shadow mode's zero-risk positioning to drive early adoption.

- **Week -2 to -1:** Soft launch (invite-only)
- **Week 0:** Public launch announcement
- **Week 1-4:** Amplification and community building
- **Week 5-8:** Iteration and expansion

**Launch Goals:**
| Metric | Target | Timeline |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Soft launch communities | 10 | Week -1 |
| Launch week signups | 50 | Week 0 |
| Month 1 active servers | 30 | Week 4 |
| First paid conversion | 5 | Week 4 |
| Case study candidates | 3 | Week 4 |

## Launch Strategy

### Launch Type: Staged Rollout

**Why Staged:**
- Validate with friendly users first
- Identify and fix issues before press
- Build social proof before amplification
- Align with bootstrapped resources

**Stages:**

| Stage | Audience | Purpose | Duration |
|-------|----------|---------|----------|
| **Alpha** | Internal + friends | Bug hunting | Ongoing |
| **Soft Launch** | Invite-only | Validation, testimonials | 2 weeks |

| **Amplification** | Broader market | Scale | Ongoing |

### Launch Positioning

**Primary Message:**
> "Know your community, not just your holders. Arrakis brings engagement intelligence to Web3 - built by the #1 Dune Analytics team."

**Key Proof Points:**
1. Shadow mode = zero-risk trial
2. Conviction scoring = unique capability
3. 9-tier progression = engagement differentiation
4. Dune pedigree = credibility shortcut

### Launch Channels

Subject: Early access to Arrakis - conviction scoring for your community

Hey [Name],

I'm [Founder] from The Honey Jar - we built the top-starred dashboards
on Dune Analytics.

We've built Arrakis: engagement intelligence for token-gated communities.
It identifies your diamond hands through conviction scoring and creates
a 9-tier progression system that drives engagement.

I'd love to give [Community] early access before public launch. You'd get:
- Free Premium for 3 months
- Direct Slack access to me
- Your feedback shapes the product

Interested? Takes 15 minutes to set up, and you can run shadow mode
alongside your current setup - zero risk.

Best,
[Founder]
