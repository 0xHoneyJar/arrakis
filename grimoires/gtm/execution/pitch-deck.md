## Deck Overview

**Purpose:** Fundraising / Partnership / Strategic Communications

**Deck Type:** 12-slide standard pitch deck

**Presentation Time:** 10-15 minutes

**Audience:** Investors, strategic partners, enterprise prospects

---

## Slide 1: Title

### Headline
**Arrakis**

### Subheadline
*Engagement Intelligence for Web3 Communities*

### Visual
- Arrakis logo (Dune-themed)
- Tagline: "Know your community, not just your holders."

### Key Elements
- Company name
- One-line description
- Website URL
- Contact information

### Speaker Notes
> "Thank you for your time. I'm [Name] from Arrakis. We're building engagement intelligence for Web3 communities - helping DAOs, NFT projects, and protocols identify and reward their most valuable members."

---

## Slide 2: Problem

### Headline
**Token-gating tells you who can enter. Not who matters.**

### Key Points

**The Pain:**
1. **Every community can gate access** - Token-gating is commoditized
2. **But they can't identify believers** - Diamond hands vs flippers look the same
3. **Airdrops go to farmers** - Millions lost to sybils and mercenaries
4. **Engagement is flat** - Everyone gets the same experience regardless of conviction

### Visual Suggestion
- Split screen: Left shows "Token Balance: 100" with question mark face
- Right shows timeline of holder behavior (held 2 years vs bought yesterday)
- Caption: "Same balance. Very different community members."

### Supporting Stats
- "5% average governance participation" (industry benchmark)
- "60%+ of airdrops claimed by farmers" (estimated)
- "Token-gated communities using 3-4 different bots" (fragmentation)

### Speaker Notes
> "Every Web3 community faces the same problem. You can check if someone holds your token - Collab.Land does that. But you can't tell if they're a true believer or a farmer waiting for the next airdrop.
>
> This matters because airdrops worth millions go to farmers. Governance has single-digit participation. Your biggest supporters get the same Discord experience as someone who bought yesterday."

---

## Slide 3: Solution

### Headline
**Conviction scoring reveals who truly believes.**

### Key Points

**Arrakis delivers:**

1. **Conviction Scoring**
   - Holding duration, trading patterns, on-chain activity
   - Identify diamond hands before your next event

2. **9-Tier Progression**
   - From Outsider to Naib council
   - Status drives engagement, not just access

3. **Badge Gamification**
   - 10+ badge types
   - Achievement, tenure, community badges

4. **Zero-Risk Adoption**
   - Shadow mode proves accuracy alongside your current setup
   - Switch when confident

### Visual Suggestion
- Product screenshot showing tier dashboard
- Conviction score visualization
- Badge collection view

### Speaker Notes
> "Arrakis brings engagement intelligence to Web3 communities.
>
> We use conviction scoring - analyzing holding duration, trading patterns, and on-chain activity - to identify who truly believes in your project.
>
> Then we create a 9-tier progression system that rewards those believers. Your top holders become your Naib council - visible, recognized, engaged.
>
> And you can try this alongside your current setup. Shadow mode proves the value before you commit to anything."

## Slide 5: Market Opportunity

### Headline
**$30-180M ARR opportunity in token-gated communities**

### Market Sizing

| Market | Size | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| **TAM** | 50,000-100,000 communities | Token-gated Discord/Telegram servers |
| **SAM** | 10,000-20,000 communities | Need advanced features |

- Discord: 231M monthly active users

### Speaker Notes
> "The market is substantial.
>
> We estimate 50,000-100,000 token-gated communities globally. Of those, 10,000-20,000 need advanced features beyond basic gating. And 1,500-3,000 are willing to pay for premium engagement intelligence.
