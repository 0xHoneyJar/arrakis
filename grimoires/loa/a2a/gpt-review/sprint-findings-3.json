  "summary": "All previously raised blockers are now addressed, and the remaining budget-integrity concern has been fixed by explicitly preserving the committed ≤ reserved invariant (by not under-reserving fallback).",

      "original_issue": "AC required “identical structured log output as before” after prepareInvocation refactor",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "AC-1.1.4 is correctly scoped to same events/levels and semantic fields while allowing ordering/timing differences, which preserves behavioral equivalence without creating flaky requirements."

    {
      "original_issue": "Fallback budget multiplier reduced without a mechanism to preserve committed ≤ reserved when fallback executes >1 attempt",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Task 1.3 no longer reduces fallback reservation; it keeps budgetMultiplier = n for all strategies and explicitly documents why under-reserving is unsafe without step-level callbacks/incremental reservation. This preserves the committed ≤ reserved invariant as required."

      "original_issue": "Compatibility matrix warning assumed arrakis can fetch loa-finn version at runtime",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Task 2.1 is now explicitly local-only (CONTRACT_VERSION vs compatibility.json) and logs a warning rather than attempting cross-service negotiation."

      "original_issue": "Test fix proposed adding a distinguishing JWT claim; unclear who reads it and risks expanding auth surface",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Task 1.2 routes deterministically using request body (ensemble.strategy) and updates stub matching to accept the parsed body, avoiding any JWT/auth surface changes."
