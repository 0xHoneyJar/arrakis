    {
      "original_issue": "req_hash contract test lacked a defined canonicalization / ability to assert against real wire bytes",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "S11-T3 now defines `computeReqHash()` and the contract harness asserts `SHA-256(wireBytes)` equals the JWT `req_hash`, which makes the test deterministic and grounded in actual serialized bytes."

      "original_issue": "JWKS 72h/48h TTL verification infeasible in sprint time without time control",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "S12-T2 introduces an injectable `Clock` plus `FakeClock.advance(ms)` and explicitly requires simulated-time tests completing in <5s, resolving CI feasibility."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "HTTP API idempotency enforcement missing end-to-end for invoke/stream (incl. SSE reconnect semantics)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "S11-T4 adds explicit HTTP invoke+stream enforcement, missing-header behavior (generate+return), and SSE reconnect semantics with `Last-Event-ID`, plus integration tests tied to SG-11."

    {
      "original_issue": "Abort propagation acceptance criteria assumed reconciliation scheduling on abort but no explicit implementation task existed",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "S10-T2 step 8 explicitly forces reconciliation enqueue in a `finally` path and adds a targeted abort-before-usage test/criterion."

    {
      "original_issue": "Two-layer auth contract tests needed deterministic tier/ceiling mapping fixtures to be CI-stable",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "S12-T1 adds versioned `tier-policy-fixtures.json` with expected results and drives all 27 cases from fixtures, removing brittleness/external dependency."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Sprint 11 task numbering/dependency references were inconsistent (duplicate IDs / missing S11-T4 references)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Sprint 11 now consistently defines S11-T4 as HTTP API idempotency and S11-T5 as budget overrun; dependencies, Appendix A traceability (G-6), and the Files Changed Summary all reference the same IDs with no duplicates."
