  "verdict": "APPROVED",
  "summary": "All previously blocking issues were addressed with concrete, implementable specs (bridge backing model, distinct entry types, transfer/idempotency boundary, governance anti-capture, single dual-write path, explicit event inventory requirement, and relaxed checksum validation) and no new truly blocking problems were introduced.",
  "previous_issues_status": [
    {
      "original_issue": "Deposit bridge minted off-chain credits without specifying backing/escrow, denomination, verification, and redemption model (conservation risk)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-2.4 now defines accepted token (USDC), 1:1 conversion to micro-USD, verified deposit criteria (escrow target, finality depth, chainId), protocol-controlled escrow model, and explicitly states non-redeemable deposits this cycle. FR-5.2 reconciles against escrow holdings so credits cannot exceed backing."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Conflation of peer transfers with external deposits via `source_type: 'transfer_in'`",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-1.2 reserves `transfer_in/transfer_out` exclusively for peer transfers and FR-2.4 introduces distinct `source_type: 'tba_deposit'` for bridged deposits."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Atomic transfer requirement not mapped to lot reserve/finalize model; risk of invariant breaks under retries/concurrency",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-1.1 specifies transfer as a composed lot operation under a single `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction with deterministic lot selection/reservation and same-tx finalization, eliminating ambiguous two-phase behavior."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Idempotency boundary unclear for multi-row transfer (paired entries + lot mutations + events), risking partial duplication",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-1.8 introduces a first-class `transfers` table keyed by `idempotency_key` with UNIQUE constraint, plus uniqueness on `(transfer_id, entry_type)` and outbox emission tied to `transfer_id` in the same transaction."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Governance weight derived from credit balance + deposit minting enables governance capture (Sybil/economic capture)",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-3.5 explicitly forbids credit balance/TBA deposits as direct weight sources and constrains weight to delegation (with per-KYC creator caps), time-weighted earned reputation, or fixed allocation; FR-3.6 adds proposable-key whitelist to limit blast radius."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Contradiction: API allowed client-supplied weight vs security requirement that weight is server-computed",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-3.2 now states `opts` includes agentAccountId (optionally delegation reference) and weight is computed server-side; NFR-2 aligns."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Two dual-write mechanisms (app adapter + DB trigger) risk duplicates/inconsistent ordering",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-4.2 selects a single application-level adapter and explicitly forbids DB triggers; dual-write is in the same transaction with EconomicEventEmitter as authoritative."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Event vocabulary consolidation claimed but legacy BillingEventEmitter event types not enumerated/mapped",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "FR-4.5 requires an explicit inventory and mapping in ADR-009, including all BillingEventEmitter event types plus new ones, with payload compatibility rules."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "EIP-55 checksum requirement would cause false rejections; should accept any valid 20-byte hex and normalize",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "NFR-2 now accepts any valid hex address and normalizes to checksum for storage/display; binding security relies on provenance, not checksum formatting."
