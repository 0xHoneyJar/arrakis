{
  "verdict": "APPROVED",
  "summary": "All previously-blocking issues were addressed directly in the sprint plan with consistent counts, explicit migration strategy, clarified config seeding ownership, mandatory transactional dual-write event emission, tightened lot-split invariants/tests, and an explicit outbox/ordering contract for the E2E proof—no new truly blocking problems introduced.",
  "previous_issues_status": [
    {
      "original_issue": "Event type count mismatch in Sprint 1 / Task 1.2 (10 vs 11 types; 39 vs 40 vocabulary).",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Task 1.2 now explicitly states 11 new event types and updates the total vocabulary to 40 (29+11), removing the mismatch."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Migration ordering inconsistency between Appendix B and sprint sequencing; Sprint 1 assumed 059 could run anytime.",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Appendix B now makes the execution strategy explicit: all migrations run strictly in numeric order (056→060) in all environments, and Sprint 1 Task 1.5 explicitly states adapter/tests must not assume 059 has run."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Config params duplication/conflict between Sprint 3 (transfer params in schema/fallbacks) and Sprint 6 migration 060 (also claiming to add/seed them).",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Sprint 3.3 now owns adding the 2 transfer params to CONFIG_SCHEMA/FALLBACKS; Sprint 6.2 explicitly does NOT re-add them in TypeScript and instead seeds all 10 params into DB, while adding only the 8 governance params to schema/fallbacks."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Sprint 4/5 event emission not required to use EventConsolidationAdapter.emitInTransaction(), risking non-atomic or partial dual-write.",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Sprint 4.2 and Sprint 5.3 acceptance criteria now require BEGIN IMMEDIATE + EventConsolidationAdapter.emitInTransaction(tx, ...) within the same transaction as the state change, ensuring atomic dual-write."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Lot-split acceptance criteria underspecified re: reserved/consumed handling and invariants; risk of conservation bugs.",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Task 2.3 now explicitly states reserved_micro and consumed_micro remain unchanged, available_micro must not go negative, and the per-lot invariant is preserved; it also mandates a unit test with non-zero reserved_micro plus a property test for global conservation."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "E2E sovereignty proof required outbox presence/ordering but no task/contract existed for outbox export or ordering semantics.",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Task 8.1 now explicitly references existing cycle-030 outbox/dispatch infrastructure, defines ordering verification via monotonic rowid within each transaction, and requires confirming the dispatch pipeline can claim/publish all 11 new event types."
