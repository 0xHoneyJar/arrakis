  "summary": "All previously blocking dependency/acceptance-criteria issues were addressed in a measurable, hermetic-friendly way without introducing new blocking problems.",

    {
      "original_issue": "Sprint 1 / Task 1.1 acceptance criteria referenced specific PR/commit state and wasn’t mechanically verifiable on “current main”.",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Now the criteria require `.reality-meta.json` to record the runtime `git rev-parse HEAD` SHA and verify it’s contained in `main`, removing the brittle PR/cycle assertions while keeping the run target testable."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Sprint 1 / Tasks 1.2–1.4 token budget requirements lacked a single authoritative measurement definition, risking non-converging validation loops.",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Task 1.4 explicitly makes `ground-truth-gen.sh --mode validate` the single authority for token counts and requires it to emit per-file and total counts with exit code 0, making the acceptance criteria measurable and convergent."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Sprint 3 / Task 3.2 contiguity invariant was likely wrong/unachievable (end_sha == start_sha across cycles) and could cause overlap/gaps issues.",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Boundaries are now defined as `base_sha` (exclusive) and `head_sha` (inclusive) with explicit `git log base..head` semantics, plus an explicit ‘no commit appears in two cycles’ verification. Contiguity is reframed as `head_sha` == next `base_sha` with clarified inclusion rules."

    {
      "original_issue": "Sprint 3 / Task 3.1 and 3.4 conflict: preserve tagged sections verbatim vs require every git tag to have a section.",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Task 3.1 now records missing tags as “to be generated,” and Task 3.4 allows generating new sections for missing tags while preserving existing tagged sections verbatim, resolving the conflict."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Sprint 4 / Task 4.3 hermetic RTFM task hard-required an HTTP endpoint for tier eligibility, which may not exist, making the task infeasible.",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "The task is now capability-agnostic: it selects a concept that actually appears in ground truth and asks for the interface type (HTTP/CLI/Discord/internal function) with invocation details and citations, which is feasible even if no HTTP endpoint exists."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Sprint 2 / Task 2.3 conditional INSTALLATION.md requirements lacked a concrete discovery step/single source of truth, risking aspirational or incomplete conditionals.",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Task 2.3 now includes an explicit Step 1 ‘Conditional Discovery’ using reality files + repo scan, and requires an applicability checklist with file-path evidence, making the conditional sections testable and reducing missed-condition risk."
