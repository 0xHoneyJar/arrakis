    {
      "original_issue": "Peer transfers minted a new recipient lot (transfer_in) without a paired sender-side supply reduction, inflating total lot supply",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "SDD now explicitly uses a lot-split: sender lot original_micro is reduced by the split amount and a recipient lot is created for the same amount, preserving global SUM(original_micro). Reconciliation Check 5 is updated to reflect transfer conservation at both ledger and lot levels."

    {
      "original_issue": "Idempotency race: INSERT OR IGNORE outside BEGIN IMMEDIATE and no guaranteed SELECT/return on ignored insert",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Transfer algorithm now begins with BEGIN IMMEDIATE and does SELECT-by-idempotency_key inside the transaction, returning completed/rejected results idempotently, otherwise inserting a pending transfer record before any side effects."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "Event consolidation dual-write claimed same transaction but legacy emitter transactional participation was not guaranteed",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "EventConsolidationAdapter now defines an explicit emitInTransaction(tx, event) path and states both emitters accept a db/tx handle; adapter forces both writes through the same transaction context and provides a wrapper emit() that creates a transaction around emitInTransaction(). This satisfies the 'single dual-write mechanism (no triggers)' requirement."

      "original_issue": "Contradiction about SQLite CHECK constraint alteration vs application-level validation; risk of runtime failures or risky table rebuild",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "SDD now makes a clear decision: application-level validation only, and migration 056 does NOT rebuild/alter existing CHECK constraints. This resolves the contradiction and avoids risky rebuilds."
    },
    {
      "original_issue": "TBA deposit bridge did not mandate on-chain receipt/log verification before minting, enabling fabricated deposit minting",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "Bridge algorithm now makes on-chain verification mandatory (receipt status, block, ERC-20 Transfer log parsing, token/from/to/amount checks, finality depth) before any BEGIN IMMEDIATE minting transaction. It also persists verified receipt/log metadata for audit."

    {
      "original_issue": "Governance weight computation referenced missing config keys and missing delegation storage schema",
      "status": "fixed",
      "notes": "SDD adds governance.agent_weight_source and related parameters to CONFIG_SCHEMA/FALLBACKS and introduces agent_governance_delegations table + indexes. Weight is explicitly server-side only."
