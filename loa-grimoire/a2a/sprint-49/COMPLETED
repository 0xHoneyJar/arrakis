- HIGH-001: Webhook URL Validation - Data exfiltration risk

### MEDIUM Priority (RESOLVED ✅)
- MED-001: Resolver Identity Verification - Impersonation attacks
- MED-002: Resolver Reason Sanitization - Audit log injection
- MED-003: Webhook Response Validation - Silent notification failures
- MED-004: Audit Trail HMAC Signatures - Tampering risk
- MED-005: Storage Trust Model Documentation - Unclear trust assumptions

### LOW Priority (RESOLVED ✅)

## Final Security Posture

**Overall Risk Level**: LOW (All critical issues resolved)

**Security Features Implemented**:
- Webhook URL validation with domain allowlist (HTTPS + domain check)
- AuthVerifier interface for identity verification (ready for API exposure)
- Input sanitization (reason field, error messages, display text)
- Webhook response validation (Slack 'ok', Discord message ID)
- HMAC-SHA256 audit trail signatures (tamper detection)
- Comprehensive trust model documentation (storage requirements)

**Test Coverage**:
- Total Tests: 107 passing
- EnhancedHITLApprovalGate: 59 tests
- Security Tests: 13 dedicated security tests
